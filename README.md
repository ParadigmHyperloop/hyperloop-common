# Hyperloop Common Libraries

_Temporary storage location for the Paradigm SDK and common libs_

# Overview

This SDK contains common C++ Code that is used by the Paradigm
Node Board Firmware (See distributed-controls), the Paradigm Flight 
Computer (See flight-computer), and the Backend data shuttle (See ODS).

Things you will find here:
 - Protobuf .proto files
 - Compiled C++ Classes generated by the proto files.
 - Headers-only C++ Libraries that are used by both the nodes and the flight computer.
